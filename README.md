This is a working Rmarkdown template which creates an interactive dashboard from a research article.

## Goal
The long term goal of this project is to create an R-based template that can pull data from public/open access repositories and automatically analyze and visualize data. This would create a living scientific document which would update as new data gets collected/deposited. This would also allow enable researchers to produce interactive HTML docuemnts that improve the layout of scholarly content.

### Next Steps
Build a framework for qPCR data analysis.
Build a framework for interacting with NGS data (RNAseq, ChIPseq, etc)
